# This is a resume generated usig HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I found most designs on resume builders to be difficult to replicate and their output resuts to be less than desirable. So,
I have chosen to create my own using code that can be printed off and given to prospective employers in a design that I feel comfortable 
assosicating with my personal brand as a developer.

*The starter code for this file was taken from https://medium.com/@iftimiealexandrucreating-a-resume-using-html-and-css-and-saving-it-as-a-pdf-e85d24b0408e to speed up initial development.*

The added and edited code is my creation.
